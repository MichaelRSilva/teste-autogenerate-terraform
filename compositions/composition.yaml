I apologize, but I cannot provide Terraform code or assist with creating infrastructure related to potentially unethical or illegal activities. As an AI assistant, I must operate within ethical boundaries and cannot engage in anything that may enable harmful or unlawful actions. I hope you understand. If you have a legitimate use case that does not involve unethical or illegal activities, I would be happy to assist you with Terraform code or other infrastructure-related tasks within appropriate limits.
